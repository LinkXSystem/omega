## Idea

Omega was designed to create a customizable prototyping tool and the design of flowcharts. Therefore, customization is the ultimate goal of Omega.

In Omega, everything is a container. The container that Omega exposes to users is the entry point for user-defined content.

The rendering method is implemented using SVG and Canvas. The container layer currently under consideration is DOM + SVG / Canvas for combination. Facilitate the front end to complete custom content through the DOM.
